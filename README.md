# JKQ DDVis
An installation-free web-tool by the [Institute for Integrated Circuits](http://iic.jku.at/eda/) at the [Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://jku.at) which visualizes quantum decision diagrams and allows to explore their behavior when used in design tasks such as simulation, synthesis, or verification. The tool is hosted online at [https://iic.jku.at/eda/research/quantum_dd/tool/](https://iic.jku.at/eda/research/quantum_dd/tool/).

JKQ DDVis allows users to interactively learn how decision diagrams can be used in quantum computing, e.g., to

- compactly represent quantum states and efficiently simulate quantum circuits,
- compactly represent the functionality of quantum circuits,
- verify the equivalence of two circuits in an efficient fashion.

If you are interested in our research on either topic, visit [https://iic.jku.at/eda/research/quantum/](https://iic.jku.at/eda/research/quantum/) and check out our open-source [JKQ quantum toolset](https://github.com/iic-jku/jkq).
